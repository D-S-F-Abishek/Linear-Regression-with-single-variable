Benefits of this project:
Helps in the understanding of raw code from scratch instead of depending on ML libraries. Usage of ML libraries is good for optimisation of code but we do not get a chance to learn how the code works, thus concluding in building this project. 

What is done in the project? 

1) Linear Regression from Scratch: Implementation of a single-variable linear regression model without high-level ML libraries.

2) Gradient Descent: Custom-built algorithm to train the model by minimizing the cost function.

3) Data Normalization: Functions to normalize and de-normalize data, a crucial step for prediction.

4) Interactive Prediction: A command-line interface that allows a user to input a house's square footage and receive a predicted price.

5) Visualizations: Includes plots for the data, the final regression line, and the cost function's convergence over time, created using Matplotlib.

Libraries Used:

1) Pandas: Used for loading and manipulating the dataset from the CSV file.

2) NumPy: Essential for high-performance numerical calculations, including mean, standard deviation, and array operations.

3) Matplotlib: Used for creating all the visualizations, such as scatter plots and the cost history graph.

4) Math: Used for mathematical functions, specifically to help calculate print intervals during the training loop.

The dataset can be downloaded from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata as a zip file then extracted.
